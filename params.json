{"name":"Gambicoptero-V2","tagline":"Quadcopter with wireless distributed control","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nGambicoptero-V2 is a project intended to design and build a quadcopter with wireless distributed control, meeting the constraints of a hard real-time system.\r\n\r\nIt has being designed as a Final Project of the [Embedded Systems Laboratory](http://www.lisha.ufsc.br/teaching/esl/) course at [UFSC](http://ufsc.br/)\r\n\r\nThe name Gambicoptero is a joke combining the Portuguese words _gambiarra_ and _coptero_, respectively _workaround_ and _copter_.\r\n\r\nTeam: Bruce springteen, Cláudio, Crysthian guth, David Resner, Diego Izidoro, Tarcísio Eduardo Moreira Cromo\r\n\r\n# Previous Work\r\n\r\nIn a previous term of this course a group made the first version of Gambicoptero. In homage to them we decided to call our own quadcopter Gambicoptero-V2(no relation to the german vengeance weapon).\r\n\r\n[Video of Gambicoptero-V1 testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExXRhufU8EQ)\r\n\r\nTeam: André Quintino Kuhnen, Tarcisio Fischer, Thiago Gelaim.\r\n\r\n# Related Work\r\n\r\n[WirelessHart](http://www.hartcomm.org/protocol/wihart/wireless_technology.html) is a protocol for real-time wireless control in mesh networks used in industrial automation.\r\n\r\n## Useful Links\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/LabmicUFSC/gambicoptero-v2)\r\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/LabmicUFSC/gambicoptero-v2/wiki)\r\n* [Trello](https://trello.com/b/aloDG1wg)\r\n* [LISHA](http://lisha.ufsc.br/)\r\n* [ZigBee - 802.15.4-2006](http://book.itep.ru/depository/zigbee/802_15_4-2006.pdf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
