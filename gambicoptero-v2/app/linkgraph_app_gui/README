 - Ex.: ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr --with-libraries=thread
4. Build and install it: sudo ./b2 install
5. Configure the Makefile entries at lines 11 and 15:
BOOST_INC = -I<full_path_to_boost_installation>/include
BOOST_LIB = -L<full_path_to_boost_installation>/lib
Ex.:
BOOST_INC = -I/usr/include
BOOST_LIB = -L/usr/lib

- LibSerial
Get LibSerial v0.6.0rc1 from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libserial/files/libserial/0.6.0rc1/
Follow these steps:
1. Untar it to any location.
2. Enter the LibSerial directory.
3. Configure it: ./configure --prefix=<full_path_to_libserial_installation>
 - Ex.: ./configure --prefix=/usr
4. Build it: make all
 - There may be some problems here with python or ruby. That's ok, just ignore. The C++ environment was already build.
5. Install it: sudo make install
6. Configure the Makefile entries at lines 12 and 16:
LIBSERIAL_INC = -I<full_path_to_libserial_installation>/include
LIBSERIAL_LIB = -L<full_path_to_libserial_installation>/lib
Ex.:
LIBSERIAL_INC = -I/usr/include
LIBSERIAL_LIB = -L/usr/lib

- UbiGraph
Get UbiGraph from: http://ubietylab.net/ubigraph/content/Downloads/index.php
Follow these steps:
1. Install system dependencies: libxmlrpc-c3, libxmlrpd-c3-dev, libglut3
 - Ex.: At Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install libxmlrpc-c3 libxmlrpc-c3-dev, libglut3
2. Untar it to any location.
3. Enter the UbiGraph directory.
4. Manually build it:
 - cd examples/C
 - gcc -c -o client.o client.c -I../../include/
 - make libubigraphclient
 - cd ../..
5. Manualy install it:
 - sudo cp include/UbigraphAPI.h <full_path_to_ubigraph_installation>/include
 - sudo cp examples/C/libubigraphclient.a <full_path_to_ubigraph_installation>/lib
 - sudo cp bin/ubigraph_server <full_path_to_ubigraph_installation>/bin/
6. Configure the Makefile entries at lines 12 and 16:
UBIGRAPH_INC = -I<full_path_to_ubigraph_installation>/include
UBIGRAPH_LIB = -L<full_path_to_ubigraph_installation>/lib
Ex.:
